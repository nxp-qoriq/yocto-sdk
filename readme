Yocto with LSDK Components
==========================
Yocto with LSDK components provides recipes for the last Yocto release to use the latest and greatest components from LSDK as they get released. This eventually makes its way into the next community Yocto release at yoctoproject.org.

Supported boards
================
ls1012ardb
ls1012afrwy
ls1021atwr
ls1043ardb
ls1046ardb
ls1046afrwy
ls1088ardb-pb
ls1028ardb
ls2088ardb
lx2160ardb-rev2
lx2162aqds

Prepare build environment
=========================
To make sure the build host is prepared for Yocto running and build, please follow this [guide](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html) to prepare the build environment. 


Install 'repo' tool
===================
To use this manifest repo, the 'repo' tool must be isntalled first
```
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
```

Download Yocto Layers
=====================
The following is the step of how to use repo utility to download all Yocto layers according to the repo manifest. Replace <branch> with the real name (see Yocto branch and version below).

```
$: mkdir yocto-sdk
$: cd yocto-sdk
$: repo init -u https://github.com/nxp-qoriq/yocto-sdk -b <branch>
$: repo sync --force-sync
```

Building images
===============
Take ls2088ardb as an example:
```
$: . ./setup-env -m ls2088ardb
$: bitbake fsl-image-networking
```
or:
```
$: bitbake fsl-image-networking-full
```
Images will be found under tmp/deploy/images/ls2088ardb/.

3. How to add custom additional packages to default rootfs?
   Set 'IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " <packages to be added>"' in your local.conf

4. Secure boot
